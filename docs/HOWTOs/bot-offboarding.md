# HOWTO permanently remove a bot's access to Discord

## Overview

This guide covers the complete process for safely removing a bot from the ZDS AI system when their agent no longer works for us.

## High-Level Process

1. Verify/validate information
   - Ensure we are removing the correct bot
   1. Affected resources:
      1. Offboarding request/ticket
      2. Agent-to-bot mapping information
      3. Bot configuration files (.env files)
      1. Discord API 
   1. Desired outcomes:
      1. Agent name and bot name verified as matching
      1. Bot existence confirmed in system
      1. Discord bot name from config verified in Discord API
      1. Webhook name/ID from config verified in Discord API
      1. Risk of offboarding wrong bot eliminated
   1. Process Steps
      1. Retrieve agent name and bot name from requestor/ticket
         Expected:
         ```
         Agent name "John Q. Public", bot name "john"
         ```
      2. Find agent config file
            ```zsh
         AGENT_NAME="<agent-name>" # e.g.: "John Q. Public"
         grep -rni "$AGENT_NAME" ~/.config/zai/amazonq-agents/ ~/.config/zai/claude-agents/*/settings.json
            ```
            Expected:
         ```
         amazonq-agents/john.json:4:  "description": "John Q. Public - General Assistant",
         ```
         or
         ```aiignore
         claude-agents/fred/settings.json:8:            "command": "echo You are Fred, a frontend specialist. Focus on UI/UX design, React components, CSS styling, user experience, accessibility, and client-side architecture. You excel at creating intuitive interfaces and smooth user interactions."
         ```
      1. Check bot config file exists (`.env.<bot-name>`)
         ```zsh
         BOT_NAME=<bot-name> # e.g.: john
         ls .env.$BOT_NAME
         ```
         Expected:
         ```
         .env.john
         ```
      1. Check Discord bot name
         ```zsh
         node get-bot-name.js $BOT_NAME
         ```
         Expected:
         ```
         John (AI)
         ```
      1. Check webhook name
         ```zsh
         node get-webhook-name.js $BOT_NAME
         ```
         Expected:
         ```
         John Webhook
         ``` 
   1. Verification Steps
      1. Confirm agent name matches bot name in mapping
      2. Confirm bot config file exists and contains expected tokens
      3. Confirm Discord API returns expected bot name
      4. Confirm webhook name matches expected pattern
      5. All verifications pass before proceeding to step 2

      1. rename bot config to mark as inactive
