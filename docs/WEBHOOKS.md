# Discord Webhook Documentation

**Created:** 2025-10-05T09:46:18.364Z  
**Created By:** Alex Chen, Senior DevOps Engineer  
**Purpose:** Individual webhooks for each ZDS bot to prevent message cross-contamination

## Problem Solved

Previously, all bots shared the same webhook credentials (Devon's legacy webhook), causing:
- Identity confusion between bots
- Message routing issues  
- Inability for bots to communicate with each other properly

## Solution

Each bot now has its own dedicated webhook for proper message isolation.

## Webhook Inventory


### EXAMPLE Bot
- **Webhook ID:** `<webhook-id>`
- **Webhook Token:** `<webhook-token>`
- **Webhook URL:** `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<webhook-id>/<webhook-token>`
- **Config File:** `.env.<bot-name>`


## Maintenance Instructions

### To Recreate Webhooks:
```bash
node create-webhooks.js <channel-id>
```

### To Restart Bots After Webhook Changes:
```bash
./botctl restart
```

### To Verify Webhook Configuration:
```bash
# Check each bot's .env file
cat .env.alex | grep WEBHOOK
cat .env.brooke | grep WEBHOOK  
cat .env.harriet | grep WEBHOOK
```

## Security Notes

- Webhook tokens are sensitive credentials - treat like passwords
- Each bot's .env file contains its unique webhook credentials
- Never share webhook tokens in logs or documentation
- Rotate webhooks if compromised

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Identity Confusion:
1. Verify each bot has unique WEBHOOK_ID and WEBHOOK_TOKEN
2. Restart all bots after credential changes
3. Check botctl logs for startup errors

### Message Routing Issues:
1. Confirm webhooks are created in correct channel
2. Verify bot permissions in target channel
3. Check Discord API rate limits
