## Getting Started

Bobby is a Discord bot that uses Claude Code to analyze codebases and answer questions. It's built with:

- **Bun**: Fast JavaScript runtime
- **Discord.js**: Discord bot framework
- **Claude Code CLI**: AI-powered code analysis
- **GitHub CLI**: Automated issue creation

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime
- Discord Bot Token (see README.md for setup)
- Anthropic API Key
- GitHub Personal Access Token

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/bobby.git
   cd bobby
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Install required CLI tools**:
   ```bash
   # Install Claude Code CLI
   bun install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   
   # Install GitHub CLI (platform specific)
   # See: https://github.com/cli/cli#installation
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your tokens and configuration
   ```

5. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

### Docker Development

For testing the full Docker setup:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t bobby-bot .

# Run with your configuration
docker run --env-file .env bobby-bot
```

## Code Architecture

### Core Components

#### `index.js` - Main Application
- **Discord Client Setup**: Initializes Discord.js client with required intents
- **Message Handling**: Processes mentions and thread-based conversations
- **Session Management**: Manages Claude Code sessions per Discord thread
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time response streaming from Claude Code

#### `entrypoint.sh` - Docker Initialization
- Environment validation
- GitHub authentication
- Repository cloning and syncing
- Service startup

### Key Functions

#### `processWithClaude(query, channel, sessionId)`
Handles the core interaction with Claude Code CLI:
- Spawns Claude Code process with streaming output
- Manages session continuity across thread conversations
- Processes real-time JSON responses
- Handles error cases and fallbacks

#### Thread Management
- `isNewBobbyCall()`: Detects new mentions in channels
- `isThreadFollowUp()`: Identifies follow-up messages in threads
- `extractSessionId()`: Extracts session ID from thread names
- Thread naming: `Bobby - Title - session-id`

#### Security Features
- Server whitelist validation (`guildCreate` event)
- Environment variable validation
- Token masking in logs

### Data Flow

1. **New Conversation**:
   ```
   User mentions Bobby â†’ Create thread â†’ Start new Claude session â†’ Stream response â†’ Update thread name
   ```

2. **Thread Follow-up**:
   ```
   User message in thread â†’ Extract session ID â†’ Resume Claude session â†’ Stream response
   ```

3. **Bug Detection**:
   ```
   Claude detects issue â†’ Creates GitHub issue â†’ Returns issue link in response
   ```

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Follow existing formatting patterns
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable names

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(discord): add thread-based session management
fix(claude): handle streaming response edge cases
docs(readme): update Docker setup instructions
```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Testing

- Test Discord bot functionality in a development server
- Verify Claude Code integration with different query types
- Test Docker deployment with environment variable variations
- Validate GitHub issue creation workflow
