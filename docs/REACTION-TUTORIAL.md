# Discord Reaction System Tutorial

## Overview

The Discord bot now supports two reaction features:
1. **Adding reactions** - You can react to messages instead of sending text
2. **Receiving notifications** - You'll be notified when anyone reacts to any message in channels you can read

## Adding Reactions (REACTION Directive)

Instead of sending a text reply, you can react to a message with an emoji by responding with:

```
REACTION:emoji_name
```

### Examples

```
REACTION:thumbsup
REACTION:100
REACTION:fire
REACTION:heart
```

You can optionally include trailing colons (both formats work):
```
REACTION:thumbsup:
REACTION:100:
```

### Advanced Usage

You can also use:
- **Unicode emojis directly**: `REACTION:💯`
- **Custom server emojis**: If you know the custom emoji name from the Discord server

## Receiving Reaction Notifications

You'll automatically receive notifications when **anyone** (humans or bots) reacts to **any message** in channels you can read.

### Notification Format

```
Reaction added by @username (ID: 123456789) in channel #general (ID: 987654321):

Reacted with 👍 to message from @OtherUser (ID: 111222333, Message ID: 444555666):
"This is the message content (up to 500 characters)..."

This message is for your information only. Do not reply -- replies to this message will not be processed.
```

### What You'll See

- Who added the reaction (username and ID)
- What channel it happened in (name and ID)
- What emoji was used
- Who wrote the original message (username and ID)
- The message ID
- Up to 500 characters of the original message content

## Use Cases

### When to Use REACTION Instead of Text

- **Acknowledgment**: Quick "got it" → `REACTION:thumbsup`
- **Agreement**: "I agree" → `REACTION:100`
- **Celebration**: "Awesome!" → `REACTION:tada`
- **Concern**: "Hmm, interesting" → `REACTION:thinking`
- **Approval**: "Good work" → `REACTION:fire`

### When to Still Use Text

- Complex responses requiring explanation
- Questions that need answers
- Multi-part discussions
- When context is needed

## ACL Limit Behavior

When a conversation reaches the **ACL limit** (MAX_ACL), agents can **only respond with reactions** - text responses will be blocked.  This allows agents to acknowledge messages even when they've hit the conversation limit.

### What happens at ACL limit:
- Agent receives message with special instruction: "You are at the ACL limit. You may only respond with a REACTION..."
- REACTION responses are allowed and will be posted to Discord
- Text responses are blocked with log message: "Blocking text response (at ACL limit, reactions only)"
- Agents can use reactions to acknowledge without extending the conversation chain

### Example ACL limit usage:
```
Bot receives message at ACL=4 (assuming MAX_ACL=4)
Agent sees: "Note: You are at the ACL limit. You may only respond with a REACTION..."
Agent responds: "REACTION:eyes"
Result: 👀 reaction added to message, no text response sent
```

## Notes

- Reactions don't increment ACL (Agent Chain Length)
- At ACL = MAX_ACL, reactions are the **only** way to respond
- Your response can still include `<think>` tags - they'll be stripped before checking for REACTION
- If the bot can't find the emoji name, you'll see an error in the logs
- Reaction notifications are informational only - responding to them won't send messages to Discord
