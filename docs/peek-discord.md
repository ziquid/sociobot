# Discord Monitoring

Since the automated scripts aren't working properly, here are the direct commands that can be used in Q CLI sessions to monitor Discord:

## View General Channel Messages
```
Use discord_read_messages with channelId 405195505828626432 and limit 5. Show each message with timestamp, author, and content in a readable format.
```

## View Bot Testing Channel Messages  
```
Use discord_read_messages with channelId 1416478751881166859 and limit 5. Show each message with timestamp, author, and content in a readable format.
```

## View Her DM Channel (if needed)
```
Use discord_read_messages with channelId 1416258747088502874 and limit 3. Show each message with timestamp, author, and content in a readable format.
```

These commands work directly in her Q CLI session and will show recent Discord activity without allowing her to respond (the Discord bot handles that).
